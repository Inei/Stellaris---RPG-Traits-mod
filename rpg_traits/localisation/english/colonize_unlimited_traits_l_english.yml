  trait_pc_asteroid_preference:0 "Asteroid Preference"
  trait_pc_asteroid_preference_desc:1 "§LWether once from a true planet and displaced, or natural inhabitants from the start, this species makes its home in the various rocks floating through space. Though sometimes several km wide, these still have effectively no gravity, making it hard for them to ever return to the surface of a true planet.§!"
